	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
	<p class="intro">I'm a professional tester with <script type="text/javascript">document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2010);</script>+ years of solid experience in automation, as well as manual testing. I'm experienced with mobile, web and windows desktop solutions. I'm strongly interested in new and fancy test automation frameworks and methodologies.</p>
	<p>My hobbies are snowboarding, vinyl's, rock music, movies and recently - kite-surfing. I really like to travel, also by hitch-hiking.</p>
	<p>I hope you have found something interesting on my blog.</p>

	<li>If my solution is badly written, not optimal, old, bad, not working, etc. – please leave a comment with an explanation why it is bad, maybe give a better solution and explain why it is better, so me and others would learn how to do it better in the future.</li>
