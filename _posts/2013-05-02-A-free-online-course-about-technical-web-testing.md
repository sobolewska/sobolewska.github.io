<a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> is an online learning platform (website) that allows instructors to host courses. The <a href="https://www.udemy.com/technical-web-testing-101/" target="_blank">Technical Web Testing</a> course introduces the tools, techniques and thought processes that helps to become more technical, and test more thoroughly. Itâ€™s a very interesting course, I recommend it.
