<a href="http://www.lordui.com/en/lord-of-user-interface" target="_blank">LordUI</a> can be used as independent program and as the library as well. The engine is created in Java technology, so it works on any popular operating system. Unlike popular screen macros, LordUI is armed with such tools as OCR mechanism, pattern recognition and image processing and many other tools. Therefore LordUI is closer to the programming language than the macros mentioned above. LordUI presents a great range of tools such as: pattern recognition, OCR, sound playing, e-mailing, system clipboard support and many others. All these tools can be controlled from the user friendly interface of the program window. The basic integration with the third party programs (as a library) is very easy and can be further expanded i.e. with the plug-in mechanism.

It’s a paid tool :(... but made by polish developers, so I’m promoting it, as a gesture of patriotism :)
