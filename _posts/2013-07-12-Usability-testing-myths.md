In <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/usability-testing-myths" target="_blank">this article</a> Rolf Molich debunks some commonly held misconceptions about the efficacy and appropriate application of usability testing. I’m not sure do I generally agree with the article or do I disagree completely with it… I would say: IT ALL DEPENDS! Nevertheless – it’s an interesting reading.
